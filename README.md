# Cardiac Cell Model Simulator

Welcome! This is a simple application that simulates cardiac cell behavior (using the O'Hara Rudy model). You can use this app to visualize how different drugs affect heart beats.

You can check out a live version of this app [here](https://finsberg.github.io/cellmodel-app). However this version runs in your web browser and may be slower. For the best experience, follow the instructions below to run it on your own computer.

## 🏁 Prerequisites (Do this once)

To run this app, you need a tool called **uv**. Think of `uv` as a manager that automatically downloads the correct version of Python and all the necessary "ingredients" (libraries) needed to run this code.

### Install `uv`

Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS) and copy-paste the command for your system:

**🪟 Windows:**
```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**🍏 macOS:**
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh)"
```
**🐧 Linux:**
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh)"
```

### Download the Code
Next, you need to get the code for this app. You can do this by downloading the ZIP file from the GitHub repository or by cloning the repository if you have Git installed.

### 🚀 Running the App
Now, in the terminal, navigate to the folder where you saved this code. Then, run the following command:

```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```
This command tells `uv` to set up everything and start the app. After a few moments, your web browser should open automatically, showing the app interface.


### 🛑 Stopping the App

To stop the app, just go back to your terminal and press `Ctrl + C`.


## Simulating common drugs
There is a list of scaling factors for common drugs below found [here](https://computationalphysiology.github.io/drug-database/docs/drug_factors.html). You can enter these scaling factors in the app to simulate the effect of these drugs on cardiac cells.
